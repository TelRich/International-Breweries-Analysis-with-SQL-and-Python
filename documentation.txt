I can use pandas read sql with the engine connection string.
To create a new column that is fixed, i used ALTER TABLE and ADD COLUMN to do so.

while populating the new columns, roi and profit didi not populate at first run. Both 
got populated after rerunning the code twice.
in order to avoid that, I had to write the formula in full with out using the column name.

Naming columns with title case doesn't work in postgresql

We have the same sales representative across all countries. same for regions.

Pandas read sql cannot recognize temporary tables. So i have to make the table permanent 
using the CREATE TABLE clause.

you cannot use sql magic with database library connector. It only works with sqlalchemy connection

with pandas read sql query, you can switch between database connector string and sqlalchemy 
connector string.
