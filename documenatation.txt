I can use pandas read sql with the engine connection string.
To create a new column that is fixed, i used ALTER TABLE and ADD COLUMN to do so.

while populating the new columns, roi and profit didi not populate at first run. Both 
got populated after rerunning the code twice.
in order to avoid that, I had to write the formula in full with out using the column name.

Naming columns with title case doesn't work in postgresql
